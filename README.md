bpo-sidecar — bag on the side of blogs.perl.org
===============================================

[blogs.perl.org][bpo] is the blogging platform for the Perl community.  This
code provides additional BPO features, not implemented through the Movable
Type installation that drives most of the site.

Development
-----------

You can browse the code, raise issues, or submit pull requests on Github:

    https://github.com/arc/bpo-sidecar

Found a bug?  Want a new feature, either in this code or on blogs.perl.org
itself?  Please get in touch!  We’d love to hear your ideas — and if those
ideas happen to come in the form of a Github pull request, so much the
better. ☺
